      I run a Christian YouTube channel called “Biblical Dhiman” to defend and answer questions raised against Christianity, God and the Bible.
  
      When I was 16, I encountered the truth that God is not in the idol and salvation cannot be earned through works but is a free gift of God. I have experienced God's presence. In addition, I have a conviction that God does exist.
