Dr. Voddie Baucham is a dean of the School of Divinity at African Christian University in Lusaka, Zambia. teaching on classical apologetic issues like the validity and historicity of the Bible, or the resurrection of Christ; or teaching on biblical manhood/womanhood, marriage, and family, or the Social Justice Movement. As an author, he has written books like Fault Lines- The social Justice movement, Expository Apologetics, and more.
The questions we discussed are as below:
1. Why cannot be many gods, or why not polytheism?
2. How can God be in three persons?
3. Is it a contradiction that Jesus was sinless, and also He became sin for us?
4. Why does not God eliminate evil faster?
5. Is Jesus still human and divine even after His death and resurrection?
6. Why salvation cannot be achieved with works?
