Rahil Patel was a Model Priest and devoted to the Hindu scriptures and committed to his faith's rituals and practices, As a brilliant academic and captivating speaker, he traveled internationally for one of the most influential Hindu organizations in the world, promoting Hindu thought in political, social and economic spheres.
Yet for all this, Rahil felt a hunger in his heart for peace. Hoping to find a loving God, he intensified his meditations and study of the Hindu scriptures, but nothing seemed to work- until he unexpectedly encountered the risen Jesus Christ! Moreover, he is the author of Found by Love: A Hindu Priest Encounters Jesus Christ.
The questions we discussed are as below:
1. What is the key difference you see between Christianity and Hinduism?
2. What does the bible say about the love of God?
3. Is salvation possible only through Jesus Christ?
4. Do money, power, and politics play a vital role in organized religion?
