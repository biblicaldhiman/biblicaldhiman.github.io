    content: "Hi, I’m Rajat Dhiman, the host of the Biblical Dhiman YouTube Podcast—a space where we tackle skeptical questions raised against the Bible, God, and the Christian faith. My goal is to explore truth through honest conversations and thoughtful study.
My journey with Jesus began at the age of 16. As I dug deep into the Scriptures and studied the claims of Christianity, I arrived at two life-changing conclusions:
<br><br>
1.⁠ ⁠God is not an idol made by humans.<br>
2.⁠ ⁠We cannot earn salvation by doing good works.
<br><br>
This theological awakening led to a radical transformation in my worldview and life purpose. Today, I am committed to helping others engage deeply with Scripture, examine difficult questions honestly, and discover the truth of the gospel with intellectual integrity and spiritual clarity.
