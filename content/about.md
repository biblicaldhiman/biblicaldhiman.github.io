## Quick Bio

I am Rajat Dhiman, a born-again Christian from India. I run a Christian YouTube channel called “Biblical Dhiman” to defend and answer questions raised against Christianity, God and the Bible.

When I was 16, I encountered the truth that God is not in the idol and salvation cannot be earned through works but is a free gift of God. I have experienced God's presence. In addition, I have a conviction that God does exist.

Jesus said:

> and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.
> - John 8:32
